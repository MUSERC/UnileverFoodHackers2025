Those are the solutions for optimization problem that is been case in the Unilever FoodHackers 2025 Case Study

2 separate Model have been developed one aimed to maximize the profit and the second oen is aimed to maximize Volume of the product


First Models Mathematical Expression:

Second Models Mathematical Expression:

Since the pulp module didn'T optimized for quadratic equations the pertentage constraint tried iteratively on code with for loops. 

Resulting with both feasible(Target Volume is yearly based) but depends on the strategy that firms choose.

For implementation of those mathematical models on Python check the ipynb files
